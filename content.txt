Audit:
Audit :- Welcome to Velocity Ledger, where we provide high-quality assurance and accounting services tailored to organizations across a wide range of industries. Backed by a team of seasoned professionals with Big 6 public accounting experience, we specialize in delivering audit, review, and compilation engagements with precision, integrity, and efficiency.
We offer audit engagements, the highest level of assurance for financial statements. Our audits are designed to provide reasonable assurance that financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with applicable standards. This includes a comprehensive assessment of internal controls, detailed analytical procedures, third-party confirmations, inspection of supporting documentation, asset observations, and in-depth discussions with management. Audited financial statements are often required by regulators, lenders, or other stakeholders, and we take pride in conducting thorough yet practical audits tailored to each client’s unique business environment.
In addition to audits, we provide review and compilation engagements, offering flexible assurance solutions to meet varying reporting needs. Review engagements provide limited assurance through analytical procedures and inquiries, while compilation engagements assist management in presenting financial information without providing assurance—both delivered with the same level of professionalism and technical rigor.
Our industry-focused audit expertise includes:
Employee Benefit Plan (EBP) audits under ERISA
HUD audits for organizations receiving federal housing assistance
Not-for-Profit (NFP) audits
Professional Services firms
Life Sciences and Technology companies

WHY US?
Cost savings
Offshore accounting teams often have lower labor costs, which can translate to significant cost savings for US based firms. This can help firms reduce their operating expenses and increase profitability.
Improved efficiency
Offshore accounting teams are often highly specialized and experienced in their field, which can help improve the efficiency of accounting processes. This can help US firms save time and reduce the risk of errors or delays in financial reporting.
Scalability
Offshore accounting teams can be scaled up or down depending on the needs of the US firm, providing greater flexibility and agility in managing client workloads.
Increased capacity
Outsourcing accounting services to an offshore team can help US firms increase their capacity to take on more work and clients. This can help firms grow their business without having to hire additional staff or expand their physical office space.
Access to specialized skills
Offshore accounting teams often have access to specialized skills and expertise that may not be available locally. This can help US firms expand their service offerings and provide additional value to their clients.
24/7 operations
Offshore accounting teams can operate on a different time zone, providing the opportunity for 24/7 operations. This can help US firms meet tight deadlines and provide faster turnaround times for clients
WORK FLOW
1
Initial consultation
We begin with an initial consultation with the client to understand their business, their accounting needs, and their pain points. This helps us determine whether we are the right fit for the client and whether we can provide the services they require.
2
Proposal and engagement letter
If we determine that we are a good fit for the client, we will provide a proposal and engagement letter that outlines the scope of work, the timeline, the fees, and the terms and conditions of our engagement. This helps ensure that both parties are on the same page before we begin work.
3
Data collection
Once the client has signed the engagement letter, we will begin the process of collecting data from the client. This may include financial statements, bank statements, invoices, receipts, and other relevant documents. We may use a secure file-sharing platform to ensure that all data is collected and stored securely.
4
Onboarding
Once we have collected all the necessary data, we will onboard the client onto our accounting system. This may include setting up accounting software, chart of accounts, bank feeds, and other relevant information. We will also ensure that all data is accurately entered into the system.
5
Ongoing communication
Throughout the engagement, we will maintain ongoing communication with the client to ensure that their accounting needs are being met. We may provide regular reports and updates on financial performance, and we will be available to answer any questions or concerns the client may have.
By following this workflow, we can ensure that we provide high-quality outsourced accounting
services to our clients and that we meet their specific accounting needs.
