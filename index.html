                <h3>Audit</h3>
                <p>Welcome to Velocity Ledger, where we provide high-quality assurance and accounting services tailored to organizations across a wide range of industries. Backed by a team of seasoned professionals with Big 6 public accounting experience, we specialize in delivering audit, review, and compilation engagements with precision, integrity, and efficiency.</p>
                <p>We offer audit engagements, the highest level of assurance for financial statements. Our audits are designed to provide reasonable assurance that financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with applicable standards. This includes a comprehensive assessment of internal controls, detailed analytical procedures, third-party confirmations, inspection of supporting documentation, asset observations, and in-depth discussions with management. Audited financial statements are often required by regulators, lenders, or other stakeholders, and we take pride in conducting thorough yet practical audits tailored to each client’s unique business environment.</p>
                <p>In addition to audits, we provide review and compilation engagements, offering flexible assurance solutions to meet varying reporting needs. Review engagements provide limited assurance through analytical procedures and inquiries, while compilation engagements assist management in presenting financial information without providing assurance—both delivered with the same level of professionalism and technical rigor.</p>
